Problem p1=The Problems We Are Facing

Problem p2=Refugees Are Losing Their Identities

Problem p3=In Syria, more than one in ten refugees were displaced because of war and have lost their nationality and residence registration. Their basic civil rights, such as social security, education, residency and voting rights have been written off. All these situations make them unable to move to a modern society.

Problem p4=Technology Giants Are Monopolizing Internet Services And Users’ Data

Problem p5=A British consultancy has managed to get more than 87 million users' data from Facebook, data which was used to target voters in the last US presidential election.  The disclosure of personal data from these centralized giants, as well as the Internet private model has become an unavoidable malady.

Problem p6=1.1 Billion Invisible People

Problem p7=According to statistics released by the World Bank, over 1.1 billion people in the world either have no formal status or lack official identification, and therefore they have no access to public health care, education and financial services. Most of these "invisible people" are concentrated in Asia and Africa, and more than one-third are children.

Problem p8=Identity Fraud has Become The Norm for ICO Projects

Problem p9=Fraudulent teams and celebrity endorsements continue to proliferate. Initiators are unable to self-certify the true existence of team members, making the blockchain industry and ICO activities infamous, and causing the community to lose trust in the system.

FQA p1=1. What is IDBOOK?

FQA p2=IDBOOK is a peer-to-peer digital identity system which reconstructs the trust relationship between people, and between people and the organization. IDBOOK is dedicated to constructing a new structure for social division of labor.

FQA p3=Want to know more?

FQA p4=Please check IDBOOK's white paper for more details.

FQA p5=2. What is the mission of IDBOOK?

FQA p6=Ensuring security and authenticity of the user's identity.

FQA p7=DataReturn identity value to the user: IDBOOK has established a complete personal identification protocol, so that each person's identity data only belongs to himself. Users’ identity data are protected and no third parties can access users’ identity data without permission. IDBOOK uses this protocol to combat centrally organized data leakage. 

FQA p8=IDBOOK invites organizations to set up shop on the blockchain and uses tokens to incentivize individuals and organizations to record their relationships in the distributed and open ledger. IDBOOK is dedicated to building a new society of individuals and organizations on the blockchain. 

FQA p9=Open Dapp portal to encourage developers to design a variety of Dapp based on the features of IDBOOK. Those Dapp can be adapted to various scenes in social life and overturn the traditional personal identity usage model.

FQA p10=3. What is ID Bucks?

FQA p11=ID Bucks ((trademark：IDB）is the only token to motivate people to use and maintain the IDBOOK network. ID Bucks can be obtained through identity exchange between users and can be used to pay for services provided by nodes.

FQA p12=4. How to acquire IDB?

FQA p13=Users can either purchase IDB on authorized exchanges, or get certain amounts of IDB from the identity exchange. 

FQA p14=IDB's mining total is 10 billion. After the Mainnet was launched, IDB unlocked 1%. The unlocked IDB tokens are no longer generated if they have been released previously in an identity collision. In that case, the next user's product condition is reached, triggering the new IDB to be unlocked.

FQA p15=5. What is MANA?

FQA p16=MANA is the unit of measuring the value of an identity. When people try to quantify the value of a person's identity, we need to collect their degree of participation in society to evaluate their social influence. In a broader context, the term MANA is close to influence, fame, social skills, connections and popularity. 

FQA p17=The MANA value will be raised accordingly in the process of first time identity exchange or identity authentication.

FQA p18=The MANA value will directly affect the amount of IDB obtained by each user in the ID exchange process. 

FQA p19=6. What qualifications does an organization/institution need to provide?

FQA p20=Any institution or individual can apply to be a node on IDBOOK. Non-registered organizations need to provide information for verification when they apply to become a node of IDBOOK, and a certain amount of IDB needs to be locked as deposit.

FQA p21=After becoming nodes, organizations can provide individual users with identity authentication and other services. Also, those organizations will be responsible for data storage of IDBOOK, and to reach consensus about personal data with other nodes on the blockchain. 

FQA p22=7. Can I develop a Dapp on IDBOOK? What will I get?

FQA p23=As an open source public blockchain, users and organizations can develop DApp on IDBOOK chain freely, and all DApp can be logged into using the ID set up on IDBOOK.  

FQA p24=Developers will be rewarded for contributing to the IDBOOK ecosystem.
